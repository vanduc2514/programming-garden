- Writing messages on Slack isn’t what engineers get paid for, though. Writing code to solve problems is.
- ### Short-form writing
  
  The first major category of writing ubiquitous in every developer’s life is chat — Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. Whatever the platform may be, the messages are exchanged — written and read — quickly
- ### Longer-form writing
  
  The second category of writing many engineers carry out daily is producing notes of all sorts — comments on pull requests, feedback on design documents, proposals and RFCs, code comments, and so on. Usually, this type of writing is to be read “offline”, at a slower pace.
- ### Long-form writing
  
  This category of writing is very difficult to give tactical advice for. The length of documents produced can vary from a single page to several thousand words of prose and it's usually where structure and flow really start to matter.
  
  Many organisations cannot afford (or simply do not see the point of) hiring a technical writer, so the task of producing clear, helpful, accurate prose falls on **you**, the developer. This, in turn, requires you to be your own editor.
  
  Long-term, longer-term, and short-term are required for developer under specific circumstances.
### Low resolution, shallow writing is first-order positive, second-order negative

**First-order positive** — You get your writing done quickly and can move on to the next task. It is more efficient.. *for you*.

**Second-order negative** — The reader will have to spend more energy to try to figure out what you wanted to say. Depending on the audience, the outcomes may range from frustration to loss of business.

### High resolution, empathic writing is first-order negative, second-order positive

**First-order negative** — *You* will have to spend more energy to make your writing easy to follow. *You* will have to grapple with your own confusion and holes in your understanding. *You* will have to figure out what the appropriate density for your writing is.

It's not about *you*, though.. It's about *them*.

**Second-order positive** — Not only does a single recipient benefit from your extra effort, what if ten people read your good work? A hundred? A thousand? What if the company CEO reads it? Taking writing seriously at work or in your organisation and putting in the effort to delight the reader will, over time, compound into a massive body of quality writing that benefits everyone. It is a literal win-win-win:
- **your readers **gain a better understanding and level up,
- **your organisation** benefits from better sharing of knowledge and increased productivity,
- **you** get better at conveying your ideas and improve your career trajectory.
  
  > Produce writing you would read with delight if you were on the other end.
